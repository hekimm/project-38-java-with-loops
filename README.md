# Power Series Printer

## Overview

This Java program prints the power series of 4 and 5 up to a user-specified limit. The user inputs a value (`n`), and the program prints all the powers of 4 and 5 that are less than or equal to `n`.

## How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter an upper limit (`n`), which defines how far the series should go.
- The program consists of two loops:
  - The first loop prints powers of **4** starting from `1`, and continues multiplying by `4` until the value exceeds `n`.
  - The second loop prints powers of **5** starting from `1`, and continues multiplying by `5` until the value exceeds `n`.
- Each power is printed in the console output.

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Copy the Java code into a file named `Main.java`.

3. Compile the Java file using the following command:

4. Run the program with the following command:

5. Enter the upper limit when prompted, and the program will print the power series of 4 and 5 up to that limit.
